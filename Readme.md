# **Enhancing Operational Efficiency in a Multi-Specialty Hospital**



**Project Overview:**



This project is part of the IBM Business Analytics Professional Certificate and focuses on enhancing operational efficiency in a multi-specialty hospital. The objective is to analyze hospital operations, identify bottlenecks, and propose actionable recommendations using business analytics methodologies.



The project demonstrates end-to-end business analysis including requirement gathering, stakeholder analysis, risk assessment, workflow modeling, data insights, and dashboards.



**Project Objective:**



Analyze hospital operations and identify inefficiencies in processes like patient management, staff allocation, and resource utilization.



Provide data-driven recommendations to improve workflow, reduce waiting times, and enhance patient satisfaction.



Showcase practical business analytics skills applicable to real-world operational challenges.



**Project Components:**



The repository includes:



1. **PDF Document** consisting:



* Business Requirement Document (BRD)
* Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)
* Stakeholder Analysis \& Engagement Plan
* Work Breakdown Structure \& Scope Management
* Business Process Model 
* BPMN \& Swimlane Diagrams
* Data Analysis \& Insights
* Data Visualization \& Dashboard Insights
* Risk Register, Risk Assessment Matrix \& SWOT Analysis
* Risk Matrix, Mitigation \& Contingency Plan



Includes cover page and Table of Contents for easy navigation.



**2. Presentation (PPT):**



Summarizes the project process, key insights, dashboards, and recommendations in a visual format.



**3. IBM Business Analytics Certificate**



Verifies completion of the IBM Business Analytics Professional Certificate.



**Methodology:**



The project follows IBM’s ASK-SHARE-ACT framework:



* ASK – Understand business goals, gather requirements, and define KPIs.
* SHARE – Visualize operational insights using dashboards and reports.
* ACT – Recommend actionable solutions to improve hospital operations.



Additional techniques used:



* Stakeholder Analysis
* Risk Assessment \& Mitigation
* Business Process Modeling (BPMN \& Swimlane)
* Data Analysis \& Dashboard Visualization



**Tools \& Technologies:**



* Microsoft Excel: Data cleaning and analysis
* Looker Studio \& Lucid Chart: Dashboard, KPI visualization and Process Models
* Microsoft Word \& PowerPoint: Documentation and presentation
* Business Analytics Frameworks: ASK-SHARE-ACT, SWOT, Risk Matrix



**Key Insights:**



* Staff allocation mismatches cause delays in patient care.
* Peak-hour congestion increases waiting times.
* Some departments have underutilized resources; reallocation improves efficiency.
* Dashboards provide real-time KPI monitoring to identify bottlenecks.



Note: All data is anonymized; no sensitive patient information is included.



**Future Scope:**



* Integrate analytics with hospital management systems for real-time monitoring.
* Use predictive analytics for patient inflow and staff allocation.
* Explore AI-driven decision support for resource planning.
* Extend methodology to multi-hospital networks for benchmarking operational efficiency.
